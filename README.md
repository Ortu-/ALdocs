Advanced Lighting Documentation Project
========================

Any user of Dark Basic Pro has probably come across Evolved's Advanced Lighting system.

It is big, complex, sometimes intimidating, a bit of a performance hog, and gives absolutely fantastic looking visuals for DirectX 9.0c

While it does distribute with some exellent demo projects, it is sorely lacking in explanation and documentation.

This project treats AL as a DBpro plugin, providing a keywords.ini file for the IDE for syntax highlighting and function parameter prompts.

It also provides standardized help files, explaining commands, parameters, and giving usage examples. The majority of these files are currently stubs, but hopefully, we can get them filled in before long.

This repo only includes the documentation files, you can get AL on Evolved's site here:
